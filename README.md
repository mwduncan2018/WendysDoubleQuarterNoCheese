# WendysDoubleQuarterNoCheese

##### This project is a demonstration of test automation with Cucumber BDD, Java, Selenium, Python, OpenCV Template Matching, Page-Object Model, and Apache POI Word.

##### The automation is running against a C# MVC 5 website on my GitHub, "SafeDuncanFlight".

##### Python is doing the image recognition with OpenCV.

##### Cucumber is driving the execution of the tests.

##### An automation framework has been built using a Page-Object Model design pattern. This automation framework is imported to use in the Step Definitions.

##### Utility classes have been made to handle image recognition and to report the output of Cucumber (JSON) as a Word document.

##### Java is a good choice to build an automation framework because of the static typing, which results in strong intellisense.
